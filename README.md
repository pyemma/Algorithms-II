Algorithms-Princeton-Java
=========================

This contains my programming exercises of the course Algorithm Part I on coursera

My Week1's programming exercises got about 96. The main reason is the sytle, which I forgot to check.
Besides, I used a stupid way to prevent backwash, which utilized two WQUUF, one contain the virtual 
bottom grid and one does not contain. So the memory cost is quite large. I haven't come up with a better
way. I hope my code could give you some inspiration on the exercises.
